# es6-awesomeness

## Requirements
Create a file called `cheer.js` that performs a cheer, using a named passed to it. Use as many of these as you can, even if the code you write isn't as compact or 'efficient' as you would like. This is more about trying out some ES6 than being succinct.

1. const and/or let
1. Object literal shorthand
1. Destructuring assignments
1. Fat arrow function(s)
1. Spread operator
1. Template literals

Execute the file by typing `node cheer.js` inside the file's directory.

Expected:

```bash
$ node cheer.js
Give me a J!
Give me an O!
Give me an H!
Give me an N!
Give me a D!
Give me an O!
Give me an E!
What does that spell?
JOHN DOE!
```
Note: the 'a' vs. 'an'

## Bonus

-   Delay each line by 1 second
